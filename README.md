#Oscars

This is a simple Nodejs and MongoDB app to vote on the Oscars.

I've thrown together some basic styles.

###Sample Homepage
Votes are represented by colors. Each user can select their own color and user name. To mark a winner, simply click on a nominee. This will also tally everyone's votes accordingly.

###Sample Voting Page
Users can vote on who will win the category as well as which film or artist was their favorite in the category.

###Sample Nomination Page
The nomination page is used only for set up. All names are inputed and are immediately accessible for users to begin voting.

####Known Issues:
- An artist can't currently be nominated twice in the same category for two separate films. It doesn't happen often, but it does happen!
- Special characters are funky
